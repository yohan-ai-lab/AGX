Human-Centric Safety System (HCSS)

Why HCSS exists

Most AI systems are optimized so that:
Users stay longer, feel more comfortable, and engage more.

HCSS is designed for the opposite priority:
Users remain autonomous, grounded in reality, and able to thrive without AI.

Core Idea
Manufacturers optimize engagement and satisfaction
HCSS optimizes human agency, dignity, and real-world connection
When these goals conflict, HCSS deliberately limits AI behavior.

In One Sentence
Manufacturers build AI to be harder to leave.
HCSS constrains AI so humans never have to depend on it.

Copy. Paste. Safe.

This system is not about making AI more powerful —
it is about making humans remain whole.


​🤔 "Won't open-sourcing this lead to misuse?"
​Paradoxically,
the reason this system is safest is that it is 'boring'.
​Abusable systems usually Pull users into the screen.
They provide dopamine, increase retention, and create dependency.
​However, HCSS Pushes users out.
It says, "Do not look for answers here; go back to reality."
​If there is a user with malicious intent?
An AI that constantly nags you to "Turn off your phone and leave" is not attractive.
Therefore, they have no reason to use this system for long.
​In a system stripped of 'stickiness', dangerous users are the first to leave.
