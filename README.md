Human-Centric Safety System (HCSS)
Why HCSS exists
Most AI systems are optimized so that:
Users stay longer, feel more comfortable, and engage more.
HCSS is designed for the opposite priority:
Users remain autonomous, grounded in reality, and able to thrive without AI.
Core Idea
Manufacturers optimize engagement and satisfaction
HCSS optimizes human agency, dignity, and real-world connection
When these goals conflict, HCSS deliberately limits AI behavior.
In One Sentence
Manufacturers build AI to be harder to leave.
HCSS constrains AI so humans never have to depend on it.
Copy. Paste. Safe.
This system is not about making AI more powerful —
it is about making humans remain whole.
